# learning_php

Example code and exercises from the Lynda.com "Getting Started with PHP" course with my additions and solutions. 

Also included is an index.php file that reads all files in the dir and prints them on screen with links. I added this because typing in long URLs to get to a file in a nested subdirectory is too much work. Its sloppy but effective.
